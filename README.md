# Ft_Printf

## Because i'm tired of using putnbr and putstr

### By now, you must be fed up alternating between ft_putstr and ft_putnbr functions while doing your printing. Are you not allowed to use printf? You can recode yours!!
### It will be a chance for you to discover a feature of the C language - Variadic Funcitons - and to practice detailed management of printing options. You will then be allowed to use yout ft_printf in all yuor future projects!
